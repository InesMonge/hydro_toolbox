For each hydrophone, there is a file containing the uo and vo currents data from October 2020 to September 2024.

- 4b_correlations Jupyter notebook

This notebook enables you to compare the uo and vo data from the copernicus dataset with the MAHY data.

It was created within the "Hydroacoustic toolbox - Geo-Ocean". Therefore, the filepaths correspond to those of this toolbox.
